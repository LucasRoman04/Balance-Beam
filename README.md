# Balance-Beam

This project implements a ball and beam balancing system using PID control. The system is designed to stabilize a ball on a beam by adjusting the angle of the beam based on the position of the ball. It utilizes an Arduino board, sensors, and a stepper motor to achieve the balancing functionality.
